# DSA_CPP

This repository contains my personal practice and learning journey in Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) using C++. It is structured into topic-based folders as I progress through various DSA concepts.

## 📁 Folder Structure

- `basics_of_cpp/` – Foundational C++ programs including:
  - Data types
  - Input/output
  - Control structures (`if`, `else`, `switch`, loops)
  - Arrays and functions

More folders and topics will be added as I cover key DSA concepts such as:
- Arrays and Strings
- Linked Lists
- Stacks and Queues
- Trees and Graphs
- Recursion and Backtracking
- Sorting and Searching Algorithms
- Dynamic Programming
- Greedy Algorithms

## 🚀 How to Use

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/DSA_CPP.git
   cd DSA_CPP
